## ---- Unit-Gaussian factor for tau_sampling_scale = "gaussian_matched":
##
## PROVENANCE: assistant-introduced heuristic (2026-09-22), derived from the Gaussian analysis of
## Hoffman, Radul and Sountsov (2021, AISTATS, "An adaptive MCMC scheme for setting trajectory lengths
## in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo"). It is NOT a published method. Full derivation: docs/adaptation-notes.md.
##
## For a unit Gaussian with exact dynamics, a trajectory of length t gives ChEES(t) = sin^2(t) (up to a
## constant). NicoStan adapts tau with a FIXED length in burn-in but samples with tau_ii ~ U(0, 2 * tau_bar),
## and the optimum of each criterion differs between the two:
##
##   KE / ChEES   fixed:  max sin^2(t)                                  -> t = pi/2    = 1.5708
##                jitter: max E[sin^2(t)] = 1/2 - sin(4T) / (8T)        -> T = 1.1234   factor 0.7151
##   CHESSR /     fixed:  max sin^2(t) / t                              -> t = 1.1656
##   SNAPER       jitter: max E[sin^2(t) / t] (per-chain mean of C_i / tau_i, as coded) -> T = 0.8950  factor 0.7678
##   CHESSR_log   fixed:  max sin^2(t) / t                              -> t = 1.1656
##                jitter: max E[sin^2(t)] / T (ratio of means, as coded) -> T = pi/4 = 0.7854  factor 0.6738
##
## (KE uses the squared kinetic-energy change, which for the unit Gaussian has the same optimum as ChEES.)
## The factors are computed here from those formulas rather than typed in, so they trace to the derivation.

#' R_fn_sample_model
#' @details Set \code{options(BayesMVP_autodiff_fallback = TRUE)} before a fit
#'   to enable an autodiff lp/gradient fallback for built-in models with multi_attempts = TRUE.
#'   If unset, it defaults to FALSE for MVP/LC-MVP/MVOP/LC-MVOP and preserves the existing
#'   TRUE default for latent_trait. Standard-scale and partial-log evaluations are tried first;
#'   autodiff is used only if both return nonfinite output, at the same parameter values.
#'   The latent_trait model skips its known-unfinished partial-log path and uses standard -> autodiff.
#'   This does not retry trajectories or rescue finite energy-error divergences. The option
#'   is frozen for the fit and returned as autodiff_fallback. For separate R worker
#'   processes, set the option in the process which calls this function.
#' @param debug_burnin_timing Collect per-iteration native timings and per-chain elapsed times and integrator step counts during burn-in.
#' @param diffusion_HMC_integrator Joint diffusion integrator: "kick_flow_kick" (default) or "flow_kick_flow".
#' @param reorder_cols_MVP Run a short pre-burnin and then re-fit with the test/outcome
#'   columns permuted into the Dissmann (2013) pair-first order of the estimated
#'   correlation matrix. Supported for Model_type = "LC_MVP" and for USER-SUPPLIED
#'   Stan models (Model_type = "Stan") through the BayesMVP provider.
#' NicoStan alone does not supply model-specific column reordering.
#'
#'   For Model_type = "Stan" only \code{y} is permuted - BayesMVP cannot know which of
#'   an external model's other data objects are test-indexed - so the option is REFUSED
#'   (with a large warning banner, after which sampling continues in the original column
#'   order) unless all of the following hold: the outcome matrix in your Stan data is
#'   called \code{y} and is N x n_tests with one column per test; the model exposes a
#'   correlation matrix called \code{Omega} whose dimension matches; and NO other entry
#'   of the Stan data is shaped like n_tests. That last condition is the strict one, and
#'   deliberately so: permuting \code{y} while leaving a per-test prior, covariate or
#'   flag in place would pair each test's responses with a different test's metadata,
#'   silently. Note also that test-indexed OUTPUTS are not un-permuted (slot j corresponds
#'   to original test \code{test_perm[j]}; the permutation and its inverse are returned as
#'   \code{test_perm} / \code{test_inv_perm}), and that user-supplied test-indexed initial
#'   values are left alone. This has only been tested to work and/or be beneficial for
#'   multivariate probit-based models.
#' @param burnin_TBB_pool_equals_n_chains NULL selects TRUE for built-in models, whose within-chain work uses OpenMP.
#'   External Stan models always use FALSE, including when TRUE is supplied, so their nested TBB work can use
#'   n_chains_burnin * n_threads_WCP_burnin threads. An explicit FALSE remains available for built-in models.
#' @param tau_sampling_scale "none" (default; unchanged behaviour), "gaussian_matched" or one positive number. Multiplies the
#'   adapted tau once at the switch from burn-in to sampling, only when tau was adapted with a fixed length
#'   (randomize_tau_burnin = FALSE) and sampling is randomised; eps is not re-initialised. "gaussian_matched" uses the
#'   criterion-specific unit-Gaussian factor (an assistant-introduced heuristic, not a published method; see
#'   docs/adaptation-notes.md). The requested value, effective value, factor and tau before/after are returned.
#' @param vect_type,Phi_type,inv_Phi_type NULL (default) = not supplied, which changes nothing. These settings are NOT
#'   chosen here: for Model_type = "Stan" they are not used at all (the .stan file defines its own maths), so a non-NULL
#'   value stops; for the built-in models they are set at model initialisation via model_args_list$vect_type /
#'   $Phi_type / $inv_Phi_type (validated by BayesMVP), and a non-NULL value here must equal the initialised value,
#'   otherwise it stops and points to model_args_list.
